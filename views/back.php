        <h1>Back-End Developer</h1>
        <p>Although a front-end developer is responsible for the major design and interactivity features of a website, the back-end developer is the person who builds the web apps that the website runs on. Web apps are complex applications that are designed to do a certain thing and are built into a website’s underlying code.</p>
        <p>Some of the things that web apps built by back-end developers allow you to do include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Taking design and turning it into a website by writing hundreds of lines of code (trust me, it’s more fun than it sounds!).</p></li>
            <li><p>Log in and out of a website once you have created an account.</p></li>
            <li><p>Connect with friends and build a user profile. Social sites like Facebook and Twitter are great examples of this sort of thing.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create interactive apps that can be embedded on a website. Google Maps is a great example of this sort of app.</p></li>

            <p>Back-end developers require a sound understanding of what is coding and languages like Ruby (and the Ruby on Rails framework), Python, full-stack JavaScript, PHP , SQL. Back-end developers are in high demand, which means that they command higher salaries on average than front-end developers and that there is a lot of work available</p>
        </ul>

    <h1>The Languages You Need To Know As a Back-End Developer :</h1>

        <img src="../public/assets/img/php.png" class="logo">
        <p>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994;the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
        <img src="../public/assets/img/phpcode.png" class="imgphp">
        <p>PHP code may be executed with a command line interface (CLI), embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.</p>
        <p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p>

        <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.</p>
        <img src="../public/assets/img/sqldatabase.png" class="imgsql">
        <p>MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.</p>
        <p>MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube.</p>
