    <p class="intro">Coding. It basically runs the world as we know it, but the vast majority of people aren’t even aware of its existence, let along what it even is. Unless you happen to be one of the few people who can call themselves a ‘programmer’ or a ‘coder’, then you should keep reading.
        Through this website we will explore the question ‘What is coding?’, and we will go into more detail about some basic coding background and coding 101. We will look briefly at the question of ‘programming vs coding’ and what the difference really is, and we will explore a few of the more common languages and how you can start learning them.</p>

        <h1>What is the definition of coding ?</h1>
        <p>Before we start, I want you to answer this question for yourself. Right-click somewhere inside your browser window, and select ‘View Page Source’. Scroll through the window that pops up and sees if you recognize or understand anything.</p>
        <p>As you may have expected, you were just viewing the code behind this webpage. Most of it is written in HTML, but there are little bits of CSS and JavaScript here and there (but more on that later).</p>

        <p>Now, in simple terms, let’s define coding as the basic act of writing  – in a programming language – a script that a computer can understand. This script will tell the computer to behave in a certain way, to do a certain thing, and to, ultimately, perform the actions that you want it to – if your code is right.</p>

        <h1>Code As A ‘Translator’</h1>
        <p>What is coding? While we have defined coding as the act of writing a script in a language that your computer can understand, let’s get down and dirty and have a look at some coding background.</p>
        <p>In reality, your computer doesn’t understand the code you have written very well at all. In fact, all that it understands is ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ (or 1 and 0 if you are familiar with Binary code). While the code that you write isn’t really understood at all, the results of it are, as it tells your computer what to do.</p>
        <p>Coding 101 – Think of your code as a translator between English (or whatever language you speak) and Binary. If you can do this, it will suddenly become much easier to grasp the basics of what is coding.</p>
        <p>So, think about it this way: your machine only really speaks Binary, but it understands different coding languages. In the same way, you only really speak your native language, but you understand the same coding languages (if you are a programmer at least!).</p>

        <h1>Why Should I Learn Coding ?</h1>
        <p>Now that we have touched on the basis of coding, it’s time to take a look at a few of the reasons why you should think seriously about learning to code. Coding can have huge impacts on both your personal and your professional life. Some of the major reasons why everyone should learn to code and understand what is coding at some point in their life include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>It will increase your earning potential massively – Experienced coders and programmers can charge extremely high hourly rates, especially if they are working as freelance or contract developers. Many coders won’t work for less than $100 per hour, which will give you an income to live up to all your wildest dreams. And the best thing? The fact that there is a shortage of coders out there means that people will happily pay you ridiculous amounts, especially once you have some experience.</p></li>
            <li><p>You could work for yourself – While many people who understand what is coding hold down traditional contracts at large companies, a huge percentage choose to work in freelance roles. As a freelance coder, you will have the ability to work where you want to, when you want to, and how you want to. In reality, there is so much work out there for coders that you will be able to only work on projects that you enjoy.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can work on your own projects – If you have an entrepreneurial streak, then learning how to code could be the trigger that results in you developing the next viral app or website. Having the knowledge to go out there and create things that before you could only have dreamed of is a wonderful thing – believe me!</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are just a few of the reasons why you should learn to code and not only know what is coding. Doing so will also ensure that you are never out of work, that you will have the ability to understand the technology and the world around you as it develops, and that you will be able to say no to uninteresting job offers.</p>

        <h1>Coding vs Programming?</h1>
        <p>Now that we have started to answer the question, ‘What is coding?’, it’s time to look at something else quickly. In the tech world, there is one debate that has been raging on for years, if not decades. It is a debate of programming vs coding. Or do we mean coding vs programming? Either way, the programming vs coding debate is one which is largely pointless, as we will go on to explain below.</p>
        <p><img src="../public/assets/img/codepart.gif" class="img-article"></p>
        <p>In technical terms, I guess that coders and programmers really are different. ‘Official’ definitions go something like this:</p>
        <p>Coder – A coder is someone who takes what we want to say in one language, such as English, and translates it to another language, such as Python. In this sense, the action of coding is simply writing a script that will execute a specific action. In official terms, a coder is a person who ‘spits out bits of code’ which are then fed into a larger computer program and used to create a website, an app, or anything else which requires bits of code.</p>
        <p>Programmer – Although you could argue that a programmer also crafts bits of code that fit together to create a program, you could also argue that a programmer is a person who heads a team of coders. They oversee the development of an app or computer program and are responsible for tweaking the bits of code that it is composed of.</p>
        <p>No matter which way you look at it, the coding vs programming debate is more than a little flawed. Really, anyone who writes bits of code to create a program is a programmer, while anyone who takes bits of code and puts them together into a program is a coder.</p>
        <p>Final message – a coder and a programmer are the same things. Sure, the official definitions may differ, but really, they are two very similar, interchangeable words.</p>
